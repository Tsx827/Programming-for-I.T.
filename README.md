The purpose of this project is to automate the research process used to set pricing for the website www.chriskickzs.com . <br />
More specifically It will use an excel spreadsheet and extract specific shoe models and sizes using python. <br />
Using this extracted data, It will then search www.stockx.com and scrape it using beautiful soup for “Last Sale”, “Lowest Ask” and “Highest Bid” for each shoe model and size combination. <br />
Lasty, It will compile this data onto my spreadsheet using pandas. <br />
