The purpose of this project is to automate the research process used to set pricing for the website www.chriskickzs.com .
More specifically It will use an excel spreadsheet and extract specific shoe models and sizes using python.
Using this extracted data, It will then search www.stockx.com and scrape it using beautiful soup for “Last Sale”, “Lowest Ask” and “Highest Bid” for each shoe model and size combination.
Lasty, It will compile this data onto my spreadsheet using pandas.
